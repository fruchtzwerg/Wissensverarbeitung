This  module  defines  the  reusable  objects   used  by  the  rendering
primitives. Please note that, as these are declaraced using pce_global/2
directive, it is possible to define any  of these objects prior to using
the document rendering primitives to overrule any of these settings.

For example:

	:- initialization
	   new(@h1_above, new(hbox(0, 30))).
