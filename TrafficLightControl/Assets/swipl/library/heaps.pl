/** <module> heaps/priority queues
 *
 * Heaps are data structures that return the entries inserted into them in an
 * ordered fashion, based on a priority. This makes them the data structure of
 * choice for implementing priority queues, a central element of algorithms
 * such as best-first/A* search and Kruskal's minimum-spanning-tree algorithm.
 *
 * This module implements min-heaps, meaning that items are retrieved in
 * ascending order of key/priority. It was designed to be compatible with
 * the SICStus Prolog library module of the same name. merge_heaps/3 and
 * singleton_heap/3 are SWI-specific extension. The portray_heap/1 predicate
 * is not implemented.
 *
 * Although the data items can be arbitrary Prolog data, keys/priorities must
 * be ordered by @=</2. Be careful when using variables as keys, since binding
 * them in between heap operations may change the ordering.
 *
 * The current version implements pairing heaps. These support insertion and
 * merging both in constant time, deletion of the minimum in logarithmic
 * amortized time (though delete-min, i.e., get_from_heap/3, takes linear time
 * in the worst case).
 *

/*
 * Heaps are represented as heap(H,Size) terms, where H is a pairing heap and
 * Size is an integer. A pairing heap is either nil or a term
 * t(X,PrioX,Sub) where Sub is a list of pairing heaps t(Y,PrioY,Sub) s.t.
 * PrioX @< PrioY. See predicate is_heap/2, below.
